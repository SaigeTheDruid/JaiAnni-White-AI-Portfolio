1. Problem Statement
In this assignment, we act as Chief Audio Engineers at Multiverse Entertainment Studios, tasked with designing voice technology for a fictional universe. The core challenge is to build robust audio processing systems—such as ASR and TTS—that can operate effectively in non-standard acoustic environments. These systems must account for unique environmental conditions, potential non-human vocal anatomy, and unpredictable noise sources.

2. Approach & Methodology
We followed a four-part structured process:

World Analysis: We examined the chosen universe to pinpoint acoustic constraints, speaker characteristics, and noise sources.

Technical Design: We crafted a customized audio preprocessing pipeline—justifying or adapting standard methods (e.g. MFCC)—and proposed tailored feature extraction and ASR/TTS strategies.

Demo Scenario: Through a storyboard (or comic strip), we illustrated the system in action—showing both failure modes and how our solution resolves them.

Executive Pitch: We branded the system, highlighted its technical strengths, and positioned it as a compelling advance over terrestrial voice technology.

3. Results & Evaluation
Preprocessing Pipeline: A clear flowchart and description of steps such as adaptive noise filtering, custom feature extraction, and integration with speech models.

Scenario Demonstration: A six‑to‑eight panel storyboard with dialogue and technical notes bringing the proposed system to life.

Comparative Analysis: Showcased how our system handles voice input from non‑Earth speakers more accurately than standard pipelines.

Executive Summary: A professional pitch pitch slide deck with branding, key features, ethical considerations, and value proposition.

Evaluation criteria included creativity, technical rigor, clarity of presentation, ethical reflection, and world‑appropriateness. Our solution demonstrated strong performance across all four deliverable categories.

4. Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, I have:

Deepened my understanding of audio preprocessing, including denoising and feature extraction in non-conventional environments.

Learned to adapt speech processing pipelines (ASR/TTS) for novel speaker and ambient conditions.

Developed skills in creative communication, applying technical ideas within narrative and visual formats.

Enhanced my ability to critically analyze ethical dimensions, such as bias in voice systems and inter-species communication.

Practiced executive-level presentation, preparing a cohesive, branded pitch for a hypothetical product.
