Sample Data / Data Access Instructions

All required data is either preloaded within the notebook or automatically downloaded through code execution. No manual downloads are necessary.

Text Data

The notebook uses built-in sample sentences and publicly available datasets through libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, and Scikit-learn.

For machine learning tasks, datasets such as the Emotion Dataset or Twitter Sentiment Corpus are accessed via:

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml


VADER and TextBlob download their models automatically when first used.

Audio Data
The speech emotion recognition section uses small pre-included .wav samples.

If needed, you can substitute with any .wav audio files containing human speech.

Audio features are extracted using librosa:

import librosa
y, sr = librosa.load("sample.wav")
External Downloads
The notebook will automatically download required corpora such as:


import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')


Internet access is required on first run to fetch models and corpora.

Ensure all code cells are executed in order to trigger automatic downloads.
