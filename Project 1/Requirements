To run this NLP preprocessing project, ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed. The following Python libraries are required:

NLTK – for tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming

spaCy – for advanced tokenization and lemmatization

pandas and NumPy – for data handling and analysis

matplotlib and seaborn – for data visualization and comparison plots

You’ll also need to download a few resources when setting up:

NLTK’s stopwords and tokenizer packages

spaCy’s English language model (en_core_web_sm)

All required libraries and resources are common in NLP projects and can be installed via pip and nltk.download() or spacy download commands.
