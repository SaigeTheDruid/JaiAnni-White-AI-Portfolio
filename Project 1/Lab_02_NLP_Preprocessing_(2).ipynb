        "*Double-click this cell to write your answer:*\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Most affected text type:** Social Media text was most affected by preprocessing. This is likely because it contains many emojis, hashtags, mentions, and informal language that are removed during cleaning and stop word removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Least affected text type:** Simple text was least affected, as it is straightforward, with fewer extra symbols or complex elements. This shows it is cleaner and more formal compared to other types.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. For customer review analysis:** I would choose the standard preprocessing approach with basic cleaning, lemmatization, and stop word removal. This preserves important words and meaning while reducing noise, which helps improve sentiment detection and topic understanding in reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Main trade-offs to consider:** The main trade-offs include balancing noise removal with preserving important context, maintaining speed versus accuracy, and deciding how much detail (like punctuation or emojis) to keep based on the specific NLP task and data type. Over-aggressive cleaning can lose valuable information, while too little cleaning can leave too much noise.\n",
