This undergraduate program focuses on providing a strong foundation in information technology with a specialized emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. The coursework includes a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practical experience in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, data analytics, robotics, and ethical AI.

As part of the program, I completed core modules in:

Natural Language Processing

Machine Learning

Data Analytics and Visualization

Audio and Speech Processing

Robotics and Intelligent Systems

AI Ethics and Society

The program also required completion of multiple capstone and industry-linked projects, with a strong focus on real-world applications, teamwork, and interdisciplinary problem solving.

ITAI-2372 – Artificial Intelligence Applications This course explores practical and emerging applications of artificial intelligence across a range of industries. Topics include intelligent systems for healthcare, finance, education, robotics, and entertainment. Emphasis is placed on understanding real-world implementations, evaluating the societal and ethical implications of AI, and designing concept-based projects. Students engage with case studies and complete a capstone project to demonstrate their ability to apply AI concepts in creative and meaningful ways.

ITAI-2373 – Natural Language Processing This course introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including text preprocessing, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text classification. Students gain hands-on experience using Python libraries such as spaCy, TextBlob, and scikit-learn to build end-to-end NLP pipelines. The course culminates in a project where students apply their skills to analyze and interpret real-world text data.
