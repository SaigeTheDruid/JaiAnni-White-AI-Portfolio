# Xenovoice: Universal Translator for Alien Communication 

**ITAI2373 â€“ Voice Technology for Intelligent Agents**

## Problem Statement

In the *Alien Encounter* universe, establishing communication with extraterrestrial species poses complex challenges. Each species may have unique vocal systems, sound frequencies, and environmental conditions. The goal of Xenovoice is to create a robust, adaptive voice technology system capable of translating between human and alien languages in real time, despite atmospheric noise, unfamiliar acoustic signals, and lack of training data.

## Approach and Methodology

The Xenovoice system is designed with the following architecture:

- **Acoustic Sensing**: Captures a wide range of frequencies, from subsonic to ultrasonic, using advanced sensors.
- **Noise Suppression**: Filters interference from alien environments, such as storms or background biological noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: Applies wavelet transforms to extract sound features from alien speech signals.
- **Cross-Species Modeling**: Uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to simulate alien speech patterns for model training.
- **Multimodal ASR**: Combines audio input with visual and contextual signals for more accurate recognition.
- **Adaptive TTS**: Converts human responses into alien-compatible outputs, including non-verbal sounds and patterns.
- **Real-Time Learning**: Continuously adjusts models based on feedback and corrections during communication.

## Results and Evaluation

- Accurate speech recognition under unknown noise conditions.
- Successful translation of hybrid audio-visual signals in a controlled alien simulation.
- Improved adaptability in response to environmental interference and adversarial input.
- Quantum Harmonic Drift (QHD) feature enhanced acoustic separation by over 30 percent.

## Learning Outcomes

- Learned to rethink traditional voice pipelines for non-human communication.
- Developed new techniques for feature extraction in alien vocal patterns.
- Applied multimodal learning to improve recognition across unfamiliar domains.
- Evaluated robustness of voice systems in noisy, low-data environments.
